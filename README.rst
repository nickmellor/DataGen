DataGen
=======

"Out of the Box" generator of pseudo-random personal data. Data is
"realistic". Names sound like real names and occur with real-world frequency,
gender, birthdays etc. Addresses are generated by obfuscating an Outlook
address database exported as csv. More address formats coming soon.

Useful for code testing and load-modelling

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 (dictionary comprehensions in code)

Output
------

- via a Python generator (potentially unlimited names)

- as a YAML file (django fixture format)

- as a CSV file


Use Out of the Box
------------------

This application should download and run as is on a hard disk or memory key in any OS
so long as Python is installed. Examples of use are given in the ``RandomPerson.py`` module:

>>> python RandomPerson.py


Configurable
------------

Example popularity tables are included for a good selection of English-language surnames
and forenames. The present files mark rare names with a rating of zero,
very common names with a rating of 5.

Addresses are also created but the address file from which they are generated is currently
small. A donated address database would be appreciated.


Obfuscations
------------

:Gender:  by world population survey http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_ratio

:Forenames: by subjective popularity table and gender modelling

:Surnames: subjective popularity table from an original list compiled in Western Australia

:Birthdays: by world population survey http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_age


Future Facilities
-----------------

- test YAML output

- SQL output

- data modelling for non-personal data

- Unicode for other languages

- Python 3.3 support

- obfuscating a production database for use by analysts without security clearance
